        <h4>Attacking Formation</h4>
        <p class="alignText">The offensive positions in a water polo game include: a center (a.k.a. hole set),
            two wings (located on or near the two-meter), two drivers/flats (usually located at five- meters on 
            the goal posts), and one point player (located  at the five-meter mark), typically, in the middle of
            the goal. The wings, drivers, and point players are often referred to as perimeter players. The 
            typical numbering system for these positions begins with the offensive wing to the right side of 
            the opposing goalie is called one. The flat/driver that is counter clockwise from position one is 
            called two. Moving in that same direction, the point player is three, the next flat/driver is four, 
            the second wing is five, and the hole set is the six. </p>

        <img class="goLeft" src="../images/Water_Polo_Defending.jpeg" alt="Water Polo Defending">
        <h4>Defense Positions </h4>
        <p>Defensive positions are often the same as the offensive positions,
            just switched over. Like most team sports, defense can be played either in zones
            or man-to-man. Defense can also be played as a combination of both zone and man-to-man in
            what is known as an "M drop" defense, in which the main defender sloughs off his or her 
            defender into a zone in order to better defend the center position. In this defense, both
            wing defenders split the area that is farthest from the goal, allowing them a clearer lane
            for the counter-attack if their team steals the ball.</p>

    <div class="marginbox">
        <img class="goRight" src="../images/Water_Polo_Goalkeeper.jpeg" alt="Water Polo Goalkeeper">
        <h4>Goalkeeper</h4>
        <p class="alignText">The goalkeeper position is one of the most challenging positions in water
            polo. A goalie must have the ability to jump out of the water, using just their core and leg
            strength, and hold that vertical position without falling down into the water, all while
            tracking and anticipating a shot. For a goalie to be able to cover the whole cage (goal),the goalie
            must be very fast and effective at both lateral movement as well as being ableto quickly lunge out 
            of the water to stop a shot. An additional task of the goalie is toguide/lead their team on defense,
            whether it be telling them where to line up, or helping them to identify a gap in the defense and
            to fix it. On the offensive end of the pool, the goalieis the "quarterback" of the play as they
            typically begin the offensive play with their pass.A goalie may also make an assist to a teammate
            by passing the ball to them on a break way/counter attack.</p>
